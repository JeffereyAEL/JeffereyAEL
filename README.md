Hello, my name is Jefferey, an opensource web & application developer with a BoS in Digital Simulation and Game Engineering Technology. 
My programming interests are engine architecture, application, and game development. 

I'm currently broadening my developer horizons, tackling different platforms, applications, and tech-stacks to find out everything I can to do with software. My unrelenting fascination with game-design, shaders, UI-UX, and game-play design push me to learn new things ever day.

If you have any business inquiries or have any questions about my work I can be contacted at:

Regards and have a wonderful day,
Jefferey
