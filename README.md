#INTRO
Hello, my name is Jefferey, an open-source web & application developer with a BS in Digital Simulation and Game Engineering Technology. 
My programming interests are engine architecture, application, and game development. 

I'm currently broadening my developer horizons, tackling different platforms, applications, and tech-stacks to find out everything I can to do with software. My unrelenting fascination with game-design, shaders, UI-UX, and application development pushes me to learn new things ever day.
#NOTICE
I'm in the active stages of beautifying this GitHub account. I have lots of projects listed that have been developed without online-VC (even though they were started here), as well as lots of in-progress applications without `readme.md`s or other documentation for explaining their existence.

Regards and have a wonderful day,
Jefferey
