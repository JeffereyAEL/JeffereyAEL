Hello, my name is Jefferey, a recent college graduate with a BS in Video Game Design and Engineering. 
My programming interests are engine architecture, shader development, and parallel processing systems. 
I'd like to apologize to all businesses I'm currently applying to for not finishing my online portfolio/Website yet.

I'm currently working to expand my knowledge of web development, wanting to learn a basic understanding of both front-end and back-end (although I imagine I'll be far more interested in back-end). This is slowed by my unrelenting fascination with shader development.

If you have any business inquiries or have any questions about my work I can be contacted at:
  jefferey.l.schlueter@gmail.com
  
Regards, and have a wonderful day-
Jefferey
