Hello, my name is Jefferey, a recent college graduate with a BS in Video Game Design and Engineering. 
My programming interests are engine architecture, shader development, and parallel processing systems. 
I'd like to apologize to all businesses I'm currently applying to for not finishing my online portfolio/Website yet. I have a few projects I want to finish and attach to the site, my work has since halted because of it. Although if you want to see my very early access site, made with Wix;
  https://jeffereylschlueter.wixsite.com/jeffereyschlueter

I'm currently working to expand my knowledge of web development, wanting to learn a basic understanding of both front-end and back-end (although I imagine I'll be far more interested in back-end). This is slowed by my unrelenting fascination with shader development.

If you have any business inquiries or have any questions about my work I can be contacted at:
  jefferey.l.schlueter@gmail.com
  or leave a message at (I do not answer unsaved numbers and apologize for the inconvenience):
  (513) 491-6585
  
Regards, and have a wonderful day-
Jefferey
